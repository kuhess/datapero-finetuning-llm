{"question": "Please write me a long/verbose summary of the document", "answer": "In 2020, Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole launched its Smart Territory project, positioning itself as a pioneer in the field. The ambitious goal was to develop real-time management tools in various domains, such as lighting, water, heating, parking, traffic lights, and waste collection, to improve service quality and optimize resource consumption. This initiative has become even more relevant in the context of the ecological transition and rising energy costs. The project has already produced tangible results, particularly in the field of lighting. By October 2023, 15,000 of the planned 30,000 LED streetlights had been installed, leading to a 70% reduction in electricity consumption on average. The LED lights also allow for adjustable luminosity, leading to further energy savings. In some areas, the lighting is gradually dimmed during the night, reaching complete darkness in certain cases, or is controlled by motion detectors to increase brightness when a user passes by. These measures contribute to significant energy savings. Once the entire operation to replace the streetlights is completed in early 2026, an annual savings of 1.5 million euros in electricity costs is expected. The project's lighting component is already more than halfway complete. The implementation of this project required an assessment of the lighting needs, which vary depending on the sectors. A consultation was conducted with the municipalities to define different typologies, each with specific rules regarding the gradation of light intensity. However, thanks to the connectivity put in place, the intensity can be adjusted in real-time if needed, without any physical intervention, from the control center. When the control center is fully operational in 2025, it will provide 24/7 monitoring. Additionally, the new equipment significantly reduces maintenance costs due to the longer lifespan of LED lights compared to traditional lamps. The Smart Territory project is a significant step towards a more sustainable and energy-efficient future for Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole."}

The plan takes into account the differences in urban density and housing typology, making it impossible to imagine a single solution. For areas where composting is possible, the plan builds on the fact that 45% of residents already practice composting, one of the highest rates in France. Composting solutions include individual composters in private homes and collective composters in neighborhoods and apartment buildings. For areas where composting is not feasible, such as city centers, the plan introduces food waste collection bins. An experiment in Angers has shown promising results, with nearly 20 tons of food waste collected in 29 bins since its launch in late 2023. The bins are emptied weekly, and their contents are either directed to a composting facility for agricultural amendment or to a biogas plant for energy recovery. The plan is available for more information on the Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole website, by phone, or by email."}

Additionally, the development of composting and biogas production facilities is expected to create local jobs."}
{"question": "Why is it important to separate biodegradable waste from other types of waste?", "answer": "Separating biodegradable waste from other types of waste is important because biodegradable waste is composed of more than 80% water and is therefore a poor fuel for incineration plants. By composting or processing biodegradable waste separately, it can be turned into a valuable resource (compost or biogas) and reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal."}
{"question": "What is the role of the 'referents' in the composting initiative?", "answer": "The 'referents' are local residents who have been trained by Label Verte to manage the composters in Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole.

They also help to maintain the composters and ensure that the resulting compost is of high quality."}
{"question": "What is the difference between composting in individual composters and collective composters?", "answer": "Individual composters are small composting units designed for use by a single household or small group of people. Collective composters, on the other hand, are larger composting units designed for use by an entire community or neighborhood. Collective composters are managed by local residents who serve as volunteer 'referents' and are supported by Label Verte."}
{"question": "What is the role of the Jardin des possibles in the composting initiative?", "answer": "The Jardin des possibles is a community garden in La Bohalle, created by the association Aicla (Association d'animation et d'initiatives citoyennes Loire-Authion).

Cette diff\u00e9rence est li\u00e9e au mode de traitement en aval (plateforme de compostage ou m\u00e9thanisation).

{"question": "What is the interest of source-separated collection of biowaste?", "answer": "There are several reasons for the interest in source-separated collection of biowaste. Firstly, it addresses the issue of treating these waste materials. Currently, they are incinerated, which is not ideal since they are mostly composed of water. By composting or methanizing them, they gain value and are no longer considered 'useless' waste but rather a product that contributes to the activity of local businesses, particularly in the field of social and solidarity economy. This separation should also help to reduce the volume of household waste and, in the long run, envision reducing the frequency of collections, at least in areas where it currently takes place several times a week. This is not insignificant, especially when you consider that a collection truck consumes 70 liters of fuel for every 100 kilometers. Additionally, the source-separated collection of biowaste allows for the valorization of the material, which is more environmentally friendly than energy recovery. This is the principle of the circular economy: compost returns organic matter to the soil. In other words, we give back to the earth what we have taken from it. Finally, the choice of composting allows for the support of a practice already established in the territory. For example, our territory has 450 shared composters, which is the same as the metropolis of Nantes for a population twice as small."}
{"question": "Why was composting chosen over selective collection?", "answer": "Composting was chosen over selective collection for several reasons. Firstly, selective collection involves the circulation of collection trucks, which has a non-negligible environmental impact. Moreover, composting falls under the category of 'material valorization,' where waste is transformed into a new product. Environmentally, this is more virtuous than energy recovery. This is the principle of the circular economy: compost returns organic matter to the soil. Finally, the choice of composting allows for the support of a practice already established in the territory. For example, our territory has 450 shared composters, which is the same as the metropolis of Nantes for a population twice as small."}
{"question": "How can citizens be convinced to adopt this new waste separation practice?", "answer": "Each inhabitant of Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole produces a total of 479 kg of waste per year on average. This is a slightly decreasing figure, but it remains quite significant. Reducing the volume of our waste and reducing the impact of the remaining waste is one of the major levers that we can all act on in favor of the environment. The separation of biowaste goes in this direction, just like the separation of packaging, which has become a daily habit. By separating biowaste, citizens contribute to reducing the volume of household waste and support the development of local businesses and the circular economy."}
{"title": "Quel est l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du tri \u00e0 la source des biod\u00e9chets ?", "question": "What is the interest of sorting biowaste at the source?", "answer": "The interest of sorting biowaste at the source is to give value to the waste, which is mainly composed of water, by composting or methanizing them. This also helps to reduce the volume of household waste and potentially reduce the frequency of collections."}
{"title": "Pourquoi avoir choisi de privil\u00e9gier le compostage plut\u00f4t que la collecte s\u00e9lective ?", "question": "Why was composting chosen over selective collection?", "answer": "Composting was chosen over selective collection because the latter involves circulating collection trucks, which have a non-negligible environmental impact. Composting is also a more environmentally friendly form of waste valorization, as it transforms waste into a new product, and it aligns with the principles of the circular economy."}
{"title": "Que diriez-vous pour convaincre nos concitoyens d\u2019adopter ce nouveau geste de tri ?", "question": "What would you say to convince citizens to adopt this new sorting gesture?", "answer": "Each inhabitant of Angers Loire M\u00e9tropole produces an average of 479 kg of waste per year. Reducing the volume of our waste and reducing the impact of the remaining waste is a major lever that we can all act on in favor of the environment. Sorting biowaste is part of this effort, just like sorting packaging, which has become a daily habit."}
{"title": "Le saviez-vous ? Quels d\u00e9chets d\u00e9poser dans les bornes d\u2019apport volontaire ?", "question": "Did you know? What waste should be deposited in the voluntary collection bins?", "answer": "Unlike composters, the collection bins accept all food waste, including meat scraps, fish bones, and shells of seafood. This difference is due to the mode of treatment downstream (composting platform or methanization). On the other hand, plants (lawn clippings and hedge trimmings), which are accepted in composters, should not be deposited in the collection bins."}
{"question": "Quel est l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du tri \u00e0 la source des biod\u00e9chets ?", "answer": "Le tri \u00e0 la source des biod\u00e9chets permet de donner une valeur \u00e0 ces d\u00e9chets en les compostant ou les m\u00e9thanisant, plut\u00f4t que de les incin\u00e9rer. Cela contribue \u00e0 l'activit\u00e9 des entreprises locales, principalement dans le domaine de l'\u00e9conomie sociale et solidaire. De plus, cela permet de r\u00e9duire le volume des ordures m\u00e9nag\u00e8res et, \u00e0 terme, d'envisager de r\u00e9duire la fr\u00e9quence des collectes."}
{"question": "Pourquoi avoir choisi de privil\u00e9gier le compostage plut\u00f4t que la collecte s\u00e9lective ?", "answer": "Le compostage a \u00e9t\u00e9 privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 car il a un impact \u00e9cologique moindre que la collecte s\u00e9lective, qui n\u00e9cessite la circulation de camions de collecte. De plus, le compostage est une forme de valorisation mati\u00e8re, plus vertueuse que la valorisation \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique. Il s'inscrit dans le principe de l'\u00e9conomie circulaire, permettant un retour au sol de la mati\u00e8re organique."}

R\u00e9duire le volume de nos d\u00e9chets et r\u00e9duire l'impact de ceux qui restent est un levier majeur pour agir en faveur de l'environnement.

{"question": "Why did you choose to direct Le Quai, the Centre dramatique national d'Angers?", "answer": "I saw that Thomas Jolly was leaving Le Quai earlier than planned to join the organization of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, so I didn't hesitate. I know the CDN of Angers and the history of the Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Angers. I have been there at the invitation of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B\u00e9lier-Garcia, and Thomas Jolly had programmed two of my shows. I like the theater and its different spaces; it's a magnificent place. In January 2024, my contract at the Com\u00e9die de Caen will end after nine years of direction. It's time to move, and I believe the West likes me."}
{"question": "What is your balance between theater and cinema?", "answer": "Every time I've done cinema, I've been sought out. Woody Allen did it for my resemblance to Pablo Picasso, for example. The film industry can be quite violent. I find that my work as an actor and director in the theater fulfills me more, through the troupes, the texts, and the very different playing spaces... This balance with cinema suits me well."}
{"question": "What can you tell us about the 2023-2024 season at Le Quai?", "answer": "The programming was imagined by Thomas Jolly, his successor Sylvain Maurice, and their teams. Le Quai is a dramatic center, but not only. Audiences can also find shows to see with the family, circus, music, and the presence of the Centre national de danse contemporaine and No\u00e9 Soulier are incredible assets. The most difficult thing for the public will probably be to make a choice in the programming. I will present 'M comme M\u00e9li\u00e8s' that I co-wrote and directed with \u00c9lise Vigier at the Com\u00e9die de Caen. The show was programmed for two years at Le Quai, but canceled due to the pandemic. The show will then go on tour in Latin America. In December, I will also create 'Portrait of the Artist after His Death', by Davide Carnevali."}
{"question": "What is the connection between 'M comme M\u00e9li\u00e8s' and the Premiers Plans film festival?", "answer": "No, it's not a coincidence. I know Premiers Plans, I was present at the last edition and have often been a spectator. I like the joyful spirit of this festival, the rooms are full from morning to night. Angers is lucky to have a festival of this quality. I want to include Premiers Plans in the heart of this first season. I will take advantage of this year of transition to do so, as I will do in the coming seasons with the Festival d'Anjou, the municipal theaters... We will also offer an immersive exhibition on 'Buster Keaton: An Unbreakable Boy', starting January 20. This master of burlesque fascinates me. With \u00c9lise Vigier, we have also dedicated a music-hall to him, which is the origin of this exhibition."}
{"question": "What is your project for the CDN Le Quai?", "answer": "My role will be to place Angers and the CDN Le Quai on the European chessboard of creation.

{"question": "Why did Sylvain Maurice choose to direct Le Quai?", "answer": "Sylvain Maurice chose to direct Le Quai because Thomas Jolly, the previous director, left earlier than expected to join the organization of the Paris 2024 Olympics. Maurice is familiar with the CDN of Angers and its history, and he appreciates the theater and its different spaces."}
{"question": "What is Sylvain Maurice's background in the arts?", "answer": "Sylvain Maurice graduated from the \u00c9cole du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National de Bretagne and has been involved in the theater and film industries. He has appeared in films such as 'Polisse' and 'Minuit \u00e0 Paris'."}
{"question": "How does Sylvain Maurice feel about balancing theater and film work?", "answer": "Sylvain Maurice finds that his work in theater, with its troupes, texts, and diverse performance spaces, fulfills him more than his film work. He enjoys the balance between the two mediums."}
{"question": "What can you tell us about the 2023-2024 season at Le Quai?", "answer": "The 2023-2024 season at Le Quai was programmed by Thomas Jolly, Sylvain Maurice, and their teams.

The challenge for the audience will be choosing which performances to attend."}
